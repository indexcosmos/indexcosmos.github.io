<div class="message">
  A favicon or favorite icon is also known as a bookmark icon, web site icon, shortcut icon or tab icon. They're normally displayed on browser tabs and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. The favicon is an opportunity to add graphical branding and unique characteristics to a site.
