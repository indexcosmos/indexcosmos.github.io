### Step 1. Make your Brand

The favicon you make can be text or a picture that bests repersents your style or branding for your site.   

### Step 2. Make a Favicon

Start up GIMP and navigate to File > New to create a new image. Adjust the new image size to 16 x 16 pixels. Below, select portrait for page orientation. I am going to make my favicon transparent by selecting the Advanced Options tab and set Fill with to Transparency. Pressing ok will load an artboard to draw the new favicon on.
