---

<div class="message">
  A favicon or favorite icon is also known as a bookmark icon, web site icon, shortcut icon or tab icon. They're normally displayed on browser tabs and next to the page's name in a list of bookmarks. The favicon is an opportunity to add graphical branding and unique characteristics to a site.

In this post we'll be working with GIMP, the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html">GNU</a> Image Manipulation Program. A basic understanding of utilizing graphic software will be helpful, although not necessary.

### Tutorial Requirements:

- [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/downloads/)

### Step 1. Make a Favicon

Start up GIMP and navigate to File > New to create a new image. Adjust the new image to 16 x 16 pixels. Below select portrait for page orientation. I am going to make my favicon transparent by clicking the Advanced Options tab and selecting Fill with: Transparency. Pressing ok will load an artboard to draw your new favicon on.
