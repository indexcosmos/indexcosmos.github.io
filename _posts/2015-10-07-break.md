### Typography Break!

I'm not sure how I stumbled across the spoon graphics blog, but I'm grateful I did. Here's their tutorial on [how to create the realistic chalk lettering effect]](http://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-create-a-realistic-chalk-lettering-effect). I didn't have a scanner so I made due with the software I had available.

I've always wanted to make my own typography. I had a lot of fun making this graphic and want to try different styles in the future.
